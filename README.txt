These are scripts for two-stage outlet glacier model (developed by Robel et al. 2018) and some related analyses, as discussed in Christian et al. 2020, The Cryosphere. They are computationally cheap and designed to be able to run as is, no input data needed. Idealized forcings can be defined within these scripts, which can have the same properties as those in the paper. Exact inputs used in the paper, and output from the flow line model, is available on reasonable request. Have fun! JEC May 2020.
